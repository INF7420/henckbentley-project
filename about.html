 <p class="intro"> Greetings! My name is Rachel Henck Bentley. I am a lifelong library user and a long term library employee. My first
  job was as a page in the local library to my town of Elmore, Ohio. 
  <br />Little did I know, that this part time job would
  lead me on a path to the career of my dreams. For the past 4 years, I've been at my dream job as Adult and Teen Services Librarian.
  <br />
  I never would have imagined that I could have a job that involves constant professional development and a way to incorporate my personal hobbies.
