Greetings!  My name is Rachel Henck Bentley.  I am a lifelong library user and a long term library employee.  My first job was as a page in the local library to my town of Elmore, Ohio.  Little did I know, that this part time job would lead me on a path to the career of my dreams.  (Add more text here)
