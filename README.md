My INF 7420 Project

I am going to build a portfolio site.  The main purpose of this project will be to showcase my work and help me find a job right before I graduate.

## Wireframes

I value planning so here are some wireframes to show how the site architecture and layout could possibly be.

Header will include my name and two stock images of bookstacks.

Main Content will be my "mission statement" and purpose

Navigation Bar will be on the bottom of the page with links for an About Page, Education (classes and important papers/projects), Professional Experience (programs I made, volunteer work, conferences), and a contact page with a link to my resume)

The right side of the page will have a photograph of me along with a few pictures of some of my proud achievements that I have received permission to use.
